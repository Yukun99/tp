## **Introduction**

Thank you for your interest in the developing of Notor! This is an open-source project aimed at helping mentors take
quick, efficient notes to facillitate effective and efficient mentoring of many mentees. The design principles
scaffolding Notor are as follows.

1. **Efficient UX for the User:**
    - You shouldn't have to wait for Notor; it should simply run -- quickly and without hassle.
    - Look for how you can make the process faster, more streamlined, or more effective for our clients: mentors.
2. **CLI-first**
    - We target fast-typers who are comfortable taking notes on their computer.

In particular, we tackle the needs of mentor professors, who tend to be busy and are assigned mentees they are unlikely
to personally know or even contact often outside of the mentor relationship. Key features of Notor which scaffold this
are:

1. Powerful Organisation which is up to the user to manage many mentees
    - Group mentees, and place groups into subgroups for greater control
    - Add tags to mentees and sort by tags to easily identify meta-data
    - Archive contacts you're no longer speaking to
2. A clean note-taking system
    - designed so that they can take notes concurrently with meeting the mentee so no information is forgotten

### **Acknowledgements**

This project is a further iteration of the [_AddressBook-Level 3 (
AB-3)_](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html) project. All features we have are in addition to
those already present in AB-3. Removed features may or may not be listed as well.

## **Setting up, getting started**

Refer to the guide [_Setting up and getting started_](SettingUp.md).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Glossary**

* **Command structure**: The order in which parameters and command words must be written in order for the command to be
  correctly parsed
* **Dummy data**: Sample data used in testing or example data present on first launch of application
* **Group**: A container containing `Person` objects with shared traits that is created by the user
* **Key power features**: Essential features that will be used often when running the software application
* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS
* **Metadata**: Personal data about a `Person` object
* **Note**: A general description of each `Person` to record their activities, with last edit timestamp attached
* **Pin**: Fixing a `Person` to the top of the current list of `Person` objects or a `Group`
* **Subgroup**: A child of a `Group` used to store multiple persons based on a more specific category than `Group`. A **
  Subgroup** can be created by specifying the parent group of the **Subgroup**. A person in a **Subgroup** is
  automatically in the parent `Group` as well
* **Tag**: A string descriptor attached to `Group` objects or `Person` objects
* **Ungrouped**: Used to describe a `Person` object with no grouping

## **Design**

### Architecture

The **Architecture** of our iteration is built upon AB-3. Please refer to the AB-3 **Architecture**
section for the general Architectural design of the app. Only changes will be listed here.

### Logic Changes

#### Command Changes

![CommandClassDiagram](images/ParserClasses.png)
Due to the addition of many new commands and refactoring of the command structure, we have amended the classes related to managing commands.

* `Parser` now takes in generic `T extends Command` since we have multiple types of commands, each with their own unique
  parser
* `Executor` instances are created by each `Command` class, which then handle the actual execution of commands and
  returning of `CommandResult`
* Commands now come in 3 general types, `PersonCommand`, `GroupCommand` and `Command`
    * `PersonCommand` operates on `Person` objects
    * `GroupCommand` operates on `Group` objects
    * `Command` operates without either a `Person` or `Group` object
* `Parser` and `Executor` classes come in the same 3 categories as `Command` classes
* `NotorParser` now parses both the `commandWord` and `subCommandWord` for user commands
    * `commandWord` refers to either `Person`, `Group` or one of the object agnostic commands
    * `subCommandWord` refers to an operation that can be carried out on a `Person` or `Group`, such as `find` or `tag`

New Workflow for Adding Commands:

1. Create a `XYZCommand` class that extends either `PersonCommand`, `GroupCommand` or simply `implements Command`.
2. Create a `XYZCommandParser` class that extends the same type of `Parser` as the `Command` above is.
3. Add the new `XYZCommandParser` to the `parse()` method in `NotorParser`.
4. Create a `XYZCommandExecutor` class that extends the same type of `Executor` as the `Command` from step 1.
5. Implement all required methods and ensure all fields used by the methods are present.

#### In-depth example of Command workflow, using the Find Command

Notor allows you to search for groups and people, and both searches have slightly different requirements.

Lets break down what happens to call a person comamnd.

### Model Changes

*(placeholder API for now, will update to our own link later when implemented.)*

**
API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/Notor-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

![ModelClassDiagram](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

* `Person` does not contain the `Address` field anymore.
* `Person` contains a new `Note` field, `SuperGroup` field and `SubGroup` field.
* `Person` does not contain direct reference to `SuperGroup` and `SubGroup` but
strings of SuperGroup and for display purposes.

* This UML diagram is the current class structure implemented.

Here is the better class structure to be implemented:
![ModelClassDiagram2](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

* `Trie` allows tags to be autocompleted as commands are entered.
* Storing `String` objects in a `Trie` in Notor allows all tags to only get created once instead of once per
  object.
* Storing tags as `String` objects in a trie is simpler than a dedicated `Tag` class.

### Storage component

*(placeholder API for now, will update to our own link later when implemented.)*

**
API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/Notor-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

![StorageClassDiagram](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

The `Storage` component,

* now includes a new `Archive` Storage component
* `Archive` allows users to temporarily remove `Person`s from their Address Book

### Common classes

**
API** : [`Trie.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/core/trie/Trie.java)

* Allows grouping and autocompletion of `Tag` and `Command` objects.
* Supports addition and deletion of items.
* Supports finding of first item.
* Supports finding of first item that contains specified keyword.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedNotor`. It extends `Notor` with an undo/redo
history, stored internally as an `NotorStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the
following operations:

* `VersionedNotor#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedNotor#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedNotor#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitNotor()`, `Model#undoNotor()`
and `Model#redoNotor()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedNotor` will be initialized with the
initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command
calls `Model#commitNotor()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes
to be saved in the `NotorStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book
state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitNotor()`
, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `NotorStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitNotor()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `NotorStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing
the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoNotor()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer`
once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial Notor state, then there are no previous Notor states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoNotor()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoNotor()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once
to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `NotorStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone Notor states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoNotor()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such
as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitNotor()`, `Model#undoNotor()` or `Model#redoNotor()`.
Thus, the `NotorStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitNotor()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not
pointing at the end of the `NotorStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be
purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern
desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Use cases

(For all use cases below, the **System** is the `Notor` and the **Actor** is the `user`, unless specified
otherwise)

**Use case: Add a note to a person**

**MSS**

1. User requests to add a note to the person
2. Notor shows a list of persons
3. User requests to add a note to a specific person in the list
4. Notor opens up a pop up dialogue for the user to type the note for the person
5. User requests to save the note to the person
6. Notor stores the book to the person
7. Notor saves the note to storage

   Use case ends.

**Extensions**

* 2a. The list is empty. Use case ends.

* 3a. The given index is invalid.
    * 3a1. Notor shows an error message. Use case resumes at step 2.

**Use case: User types a command**

**MSS**

1. User starts typing a command in Notor
2. Notor shows possible commands starting with what user has typed
3. User presses tab to select the right command
4. User presses enter to execute the selected command
5. Notor <u>runs command (UC1)</u>

   Use case ends.

**Extensions**

* 2a. The typed string is not in any command.
    * 2a1. Notor displays no commands. Use case resumes at step 1.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2. Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e., not code, not system admin commands) should be
   able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4. Installing a new update shall not in any way, modify or erase existing data and value from the previous version, and
   the new update should be compatible with the data produced earlier within the system.
5. Should be able to store notes in English language, and provisions shall be made to support all languages.
6. The system should be able to handle notes with at most 1000 lines without any noticeable decrease in performance, so
   that users can keep extensive notes on their mentees.
7. The user should not lose any data if the system exits prematurely.
8. The system should be able to reply to the prompt or command from the user within 3 seconds.
9. The system should be intuitive to use for a mentor professor.
10. Should ensure personal data privacy and security of data access.
11. Software testing will require the use of automated testing. The test will be deleted after successful implementation
    of the software system.
